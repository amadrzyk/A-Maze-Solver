# A* Maze Solver

This Java program uses a version of the A* algorithm to calculate the shortest path from the start tile of the maze to the end tile. Then, it prints out whether or not it found an end tile, the number of steps it took to get to the end tile, the number of tiles still in the priority queue, and the number of steps taken.

It uses a priority queue that keeps track of which tile to visit next. 

## Getting Started

Open the folder in Eclipse, and run ```ImLostToo.java```. Under run configurations, be sure to add ```maze/maze#.txt``` as an argument. The text files in the maze folders are what the program uses to build the maze.
